about_text: "These Texts is a collection of messages I've received from people I know,
  or knew at some point. The messages are organized chronologically. \n\nWhile the
  messages date back as far as 2014, I began collecting and posting them in September
  2016. The project is somewhat inspired by Jamie Livingston's [Some Photos of That
  Day](http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/), Miranda July's [We Think Alone](http://wethinkalone.com/),
  and the slew of similar [stuff](https://www.google.com/search?client=chrome-omni&ei=Nb61WuGWCNHGwAKSmYmIDw&q=funny+texts&oq=funny+texts&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i131i67k1j0i131k1j0l8.9159.10419.0.10635.11.11.0.0.0.0.199.1098.6j4.10.0..2..0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.10.1093...0i67k1.0.jve8-USEbQM)
  already out there. \n\nQuestions, comments, concerns? [Text me](http://willanderson.co/). "

                    <p>Hey will this is probably long overdue but I'm sorry for unfollowing you on Instagram. I did that to try and make getting back with my ex easier for both of us, and I'm sorry if my abruptness hurt or confused you. I realized now how rude that was and I just wanted to say thanks for hanging out with me over the past few months! It was a good time haha, and thanks for showing me around everlane and introducing me to Veep lol. You're an awesome guy, hopefully we can stay friends, or at least don't ignore me if you see me around! Haha take care man</p>

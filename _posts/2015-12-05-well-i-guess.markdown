- message: Well I guess I should've known better, and I guess I kinda of did. I hope
    you don't do this to anyone else ever again. I can take it but not everyone can.
    You hurt me and I hope you know that and know why. Regardless, I am glad I met
    you. You taught me not to trust what a guy says when you're in bed, no matter
    how convincing they seem. I'm not angry or vindictive and I can see now that it
    never would have worked; but I hope this strikes a chord of guilt in you, if one
    exists at all. Bye.

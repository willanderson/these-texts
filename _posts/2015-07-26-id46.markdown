- message: Hey will this is probably long overdue but I'm sorry for unfollowing you
    on Instagram. I did that to try and make getting back with my ex easier for both
    of us, and I'm sorry if my abruptness hurt or confused you. I realized now how
    rude that was and I just wanted to say thanks for hanging out with me over the
    past few months! It was a good time haha, and thanks for showing me around everlane
    and introducing me to Veep lol. You're an awesome guy, hopefully we can stay friends,
    or at least don't ignore me if you see me around! Haha take care man

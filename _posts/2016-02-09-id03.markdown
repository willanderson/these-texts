    it sounds torturous. im sad ill never get the feeling of hopping in a car to get
    to the room above the bar. the smell of your freaking vape, your ikea covers,
    your bread loaf. sad you dont want it anymore, or cant bring yourself to. i wish
    i was 24 and on divisadero. i cant be enough so thats why i feel sorry. its just
    sad.
